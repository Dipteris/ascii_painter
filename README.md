## ASCII Character Sets

Choose from 7 carefully designed character sets:

1. **8-Level Minimalist (Classic)**: ` .:-=+*#%@`
2. **10-Level Coarse (Balanced)**: ` .'`^:!|#@`
3. **16-Level Alternative (Smoother)**: ` .'`^\":;Il!i~+*#%` (Default)
4. **Unicode Blocks**: ` ‚ñë‚ñí‚ñì‚ñà`
5. **Unicode Dot Patterns**: ` ‚†Ä‚†Ñ‚†Ü‚†á‚†ø‚£ø`
6. **Unicode Mixed Symbols**: ` ¬∑‚àò‚óã‚óè‚óâ‚ñà`
7. **Unicode Shade Blocks**: ` ‚ñÅ‚ñÇ‚ñÉ‚ñÑ‚ñÖ‚ñÜ‚ñá‚ñà`

## Requirements

- Python 3.8 or higher
- UV package manager (recommended) or pip

## Installation & Usage

### Using UV (Recommended)

1. **Clone and navigate to the project**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Dipteris/ascii_painter.git
   cd ascii_painter
   ```

2. **Run directly with UV**:
   ```bash
   uv run main.py
   ```

### Alternative Method

1. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   uv sync
   ```

2. **Run the application**:
   ```bash
   uv run main.py
   ```

## User Interface

The interface features a professional 3-section layout:

### Top Row - Professional Controls
- **Histogram**: Real-time grayscale histogram with grid lines (matches Original Image width)
- **Image Adjustments**: Photoshop-style levels and basic adjustments with individual reset buttons
- **Controls**: ASCII width, aspect ratio, mode selection, and invert colors

### Middle Row - 1:1 Viewers
- **Original Image**: Displays the selected image with zoom capability (left side)
- **ASCII Art**: Shows the converted ASCII art with font size controls (right side)

### Bottom Row - Action Controls
- **Image Controls**: Select Image, zoom In/Out/Reset for the original image
- **ASCII Controls**: Save ASCII, Copy to Clipboard, font size In/Out/Reset

## How to Use

1. **Select an Image**: Click "Select Image" to choose your image file
2. **Auto-conversion**: ASCII art generates automatically upon selection with intelligent optimization
3. **Adjust Parameters**: 
   - **Width & Aspect Ratio**: Drag sliders, use spinbox arrows, or type exact values + Enter
   - **Image Adjustments**: Fine-tune levels (Black, Gamma, White) and basic adjustments (Brightness, Contrast)
   - **ASCII Style**: Select from 7 different character sets
   - **Invert Colors**: Toggle between normal and inverted brightness mapping
4. **Monitor Histogram**: Watch real-time pixel distribution changes as you adjust settings
5. **Zoom Views**: Use controls below each viewer to zoom in/out independently
6. **Export**: Save to file or copy to clipboard when satisfied

## Technical Details

### Intelligent Image Processing
- **Smart Optimization**: Automatically downsizes large images (max 800px width) for faster performance while preserving ASCII quality
- **High-Quality Resampling**: Uses LANCZOS algorithm to maintain detail during resizing
- **Adaptive Processing**: Skips unnecessary adjustments when values are at defaults
- **Aspect Ratio Control**: User-adjustable aspect ratio with 100% = no distortion, 55% = character compensation

### Professional Image Adjustments
- **Levels Control**: Black level (0-255), Gamma (0.1-3.0), White level (0-255)
- **Basic Adjustments**: Brightness (-100 to +100), Contrast (-100 to +100)
- **Real-time Histogram**: Live pixel distribution visualization with grid lines
- **Invert Colors**: Toggle between normal and inverted brightness mapping

### Conversion Algorithm
- Maintains aspect ratio during resizing
- Converts to grayscale for optimal character mapping
- Maps pixel brightness to character density
- Applies user-adjustable character height compensation

### Advanced Features
- **Real-time Everything**: Instant feedback on all parameter changes with live histogram updates
- **Multiple Input Methods**: Sliders, spinboxes with up/down arrows, and direct text entry
- **Preference Persistence**: All settings saved in `ascii_painter_config.json`
- **Unicode Support**: Modern character sets for enhanced visual quality
- **Responsive Interface**: Professional layout with 1:1 viewer ratio and adaptive histogram sizing
